    Temperature reported is in Fahrenheit.  Connect to Arduino using
    pyfirmata and read voltages across thermistor in thermistor-resistor
    circuit.  Perform conversions and use Steinhart-Hart equation to
    determine the temperature at the head of the thermistor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_points : int
        Specify the number of readings to gather and average over;
        default 10
    seconds : int or float
        Across how many seconds the data points should be evenly spaced
        across; default 10

    Example
    ----------
    The following records 5 datapoints across 10 seconds (2 seconds
    between recordings) and then averages them, truncating all decimal
    places.
