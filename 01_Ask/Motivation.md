# Room Temperature Project Motivation and Setup

## Goal 
First, I'd have an outline of the situation and structure the focus/goal of the project.
Spurred by the seemingly inconsistent temperature in my bedroom, I want to find out temperature patterns in my room and whether or not (and if so, how) the outside temperature can be used as a predictor so that I can set the timer on my fan to try and keep the room as consistent a temperature as possible.

## Stakeholders
Typically here is where I would include a list of all the stakeholders in this project along with each of their expectations and what insights they hope to gain from this analysis project. 
In this case, I'm the lone stakeholder since this project only effects me and I expect to get an insight into the temperature patterns in my room during summer months (Northern Hemisphere).

## Scope of Work and Timetable
I'd next want to outline a scope of work so that I can know exactly what I am responsible for and what duties and tasks will be performed by other members of the team. This scope of work should include tentative milestone dates, building in potential time off, other projects, or any other foreseeable delays so that we can establish the most likely timetable for the project. 
For this project, as a short summary: 
> ### Scope of Work
> I'll be handling all of the work alone in the following order:
>1. I expect to (starting during mid-June) finish the data collection methods and have data collection up and running by the 3rd week of June.
>2. As soon as the instrument is working properly and writing to the database properly, I'll have it collect data through August.
>3. Data collection will stop September 1 (this is an arbitrary date and not intended to reflect the exact end of the summer season) and data cleaning and processing will begin thereafter. Given the uncertainty of my working schedule, its impractical to put a timetable here but I can assume this will be completed sometime during the month.
>4. Analysis of the cleaned data is the next step and should be completed during my free time over the course of a few weeks, concluding, at worst, by the end of October.
>5. The last thing to wrap up would be to put together the results of the analysis into a presentation and make final conclusions.
